The setup requires a **proot-distro** bypass because Android's kernel blocks Node.js network interfaces, causing *System Error 13* crashes.\n\nHere is the concise automation-ready setup:\n\n## 1. Base Environment\nInstall **Termux from F-Droid** (Play Store builds are deprecated). Then:\n\n```bash\npkg update && pkg upgrade -y\npkg install proot-distro -y\nproot-distro install ubuntu\nproot-distro login ubuntu\n```\n\n## 2. Install OpenClaw\nInside the Ubuntu proot:\n\n```bash\napt update && apt install -y curl git build-essential\ncurl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -\napt install -y nodejs\nnpm install -g openclaw@latest\n```\n\n## 3. The \"Bionic Bypass\" (Critical)\nAndroid blocks `os.networkInterfaces()`. Create a hijack script:\n\n```bash\ncat << 'EOF' > /root/hijack.js\nconst os = require('os');\nos.networkInterfaces = () => ({});\nEOF\n\necho 'export NODE_OPTIONS=\"-r /root/hijack.js\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n## 4. Onboard & Configure\nRun the wizard and **select Loopback (127.0.0.1)** when asked for Gateway Bind (LAN/0.0.0.0 crashes on non-rooted Android):\n\n```bash\nopenclaw onboard\nopenclaw config set gateway.auth.token <your-token>\n```\n\n## 5. Termux-[cmd] Automation Extensions\n\n### A. Termux:Tasker Plugin\nInstall **Termux:Tasker** from F-Droid. Grant `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` in Android Settings → Apps → Tasker → Additional Permissions.\n\nCreate the tasker directory:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.termux/tasker\nchmod 700 -R ~/.termux\n```\n\nPlace launcher scripts in `~/.termux/tasker/`:\n```bash\n#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash\n# openclaw-gateway.sh\nproot-distro login ubuntu -- openclaw gateway --verbose\n```\n\nIn Tasker, use the **Termux:Tasker** action → Executable: `openclaw-gateway.sh`.\n\n### B. RUN_COMMAND Intent (For MacroDroid/Automate)\nEnable external commands:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.termux\necho \"allow-external-apps=true\" >> ~/.termux/termux.properties\n```\n\nThen trigger via intent from any automation app:\n- **Action**: `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND`\n- **Extra**: `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND_PATH` → `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/openclaw-gateway.sh`\n- **Extra**: `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND_BACKGROUND` → `true`\n\n### C. Termux:Widget Shortcuts\nInstall **Termux:Widget**. Scripts in `~/.shortcuts/` appear as home screen widgets:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.shortcuts\necho \"proot-distro login ubuntu -- openclaw gateway\" > ~/.shortcuts/OpenClaw-Start\nchmod +x ~/.shortcuts/OpenClaw-Start\n```\n\n## 6. Keep-Alive Automation\nPrevent Android from killing the session:\n\n```bash\n# In Termux (not proot)\ntermux-wake-lock\n```\n\nAdd to your Termux startup (`~/.bashrc`):\n```bash\ntermux-wake-lock\n```\n\nDisable battery optimization for Termux in Android settings.\n\n## 7. Quick Status Commands\nOnce running, automate health checks via Tasker HTTP GET to `http://127.0.0.1:18789/status` using your gateway token.\n\n**Note:** If you meant the **game** OpenClaw (SDL2 platformer), you need `termux-sdl` from GitHub (lzhiyong/termux-sdl) and must compile it with CMake inside Termux, not proot. The AI assistant setup above is the one currently trending for \"Termux automation\" workflows.","created_at":1770255220274,"messageId":"e2b43c91-f044-4aef-9b34-6cdcbcfec759","model":"kimi-k2.5-thinking","modelParams":{"includeSearch":true,"reasoningEffort":"medium"},"parts":[{"providerMetadata":{"openrouter":{"reasoning_details":[{"format":"unknown","index":0,"text":".","type":"reasoning.text"}]}},"reasoning":"The user is asking about running OpenClaw on their phone using Termux, specifically with \"[cmd]\" extensions to automate. \n\nOpenClaw is an open-source reimplementation of the 1997 platform game \"Claw\" by Monolith Productions.

Step-by-step guide for coding, Linux tools, and ethical hacking without root access.\n# How to Setup Termux on Android\nHave you ever been stuck with just your Android phone, wishing you could get back to a powerful development environment? What if you could run a full Linux distribution and powerful development tools directly on your mobile device, without needing root access? Welcome to Termux, the game-changing Android app that transforms your smartphone into a portable coding powerhouse. This definitive guide will walk you through exactly how to setup Termux on Android properly, unlocking a world of programming, scripting, and ethical hacking possibilities right from the palm of your hand.\n[![]] \n## Introduction\nTermux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that enables users to run a full-fledged Linux distribution on their Android devices. It provides a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to execute various Unix commands, run shell scripts, and access a wide range of Linux tools and utilities directly on your smartphone or tablet. Whether you're a developer wanting to code on the go, a student learning Linux commands, or a cybersecurity enthusiast exploring ethical hacking tools, mastering**how to setup Termux on Android**opens up incredible possibilities. This 1500-word guide will take you from complete beginner to Termux proficient user, covering installation, essential commands, package management, and expert techniques that few users fully utilize.\n## Understanding the Core Concept\nBefore diving into the setup process, it's crucial to understand what makes Termux special and why it's become such an invaluable tool for developers and tech enthusiasts.\nAt its core, Termux is essentially a terminal emulator that provides a Linux environment compatible with Android. Unlike virtual machines or emulators, Termux runs natively on Android using a minimal base system, making it remarkably efficient and responsive even on mid-range devices.\nKey capabilities include:\n* **Package Management**: Termux includes a package manager (pkg) that allows you to install various software packages from a vast repository of Linux tools and utilities .\n* : You can write, compile, and run code in languages like Python, Ruby, Node.js, and C/C++ directly on your Android device .\n* **File System Access**: With proper permissions, you can access and manipulate files on your device's storage .\n* **Scripting &amp; Automation**: Create and run shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks .\n* **Networking Tools**: Use powerful tools like Nmap, cURL, and OpenSSH for network testing and administration .## Hidden or Rarely-Known Insights\nWhile many guides cover basic Termux installation, several advanced insights can significantly enhance your experience and capabilities.\n💡**Did You Know?**The Google Play Store version of Termux is no longer maintained and doesn't support the latest packages. Installing from F-Droid is crucial for accessing current repositories and security updates .\nOne particularly valuable but underutilized capability is running a full desktop environment with hardware acceleration. Through projects like Termux-X11 and proper configuration, you can run Linux desktop applications with surprising performance . This goes far beyond basic terminal usage and transforms your Android device into a genuine desktop replacement for many development tasks.\nAnother advanced insight involves the storage access limitations on newer Android versions. While`termux-setup-storage`traditionally granted broad file access, Android 14 introduced changes that can break this functionality . Understanding these limitations helps you plan your workflow and avoid frustration.\nFor developers, an incredible but rarely discussed feature is the ability to run code-server (VS Code in the browser). This transforms Termux into a cloud-like development environment accessible from any device on your network, with the official documentation providing specific installation guidance for Termux .\n## Comparison Table: Basic vs Advanced Termux Use\n|Feature|Basic Concept|Advanced Insight (Pro Level)|\nPerformance|Runs basic Linux commands and scripts with standard speed|Uses PRoot or chroot for near-native performance; optimizes package selection to reduce resource usage|\nUse Case|Learning Linux commands, basic Python scripting|Full penetration testing with Nethunter , VS Code server development environment , hardware-accelerated desktop|\nStorage Access|Basic file management in designated folders|Workarounds for Android 14 limitations , symbolic linking strategies for broader access|\nTool Installation|Basic package installation via pkg command|GitHub script automation , custom compilation for unsupported tools, dependency resolution|\nIntegration|Standalone terminal usage|SSH server setup for remote access, integration with Android automation apps, cross-device workflows|\n## Step-by-Step Guide\nFollow this comprehensive step-by-step guide to properly setup Termux on your Android device, avoiding common pitfalls and ensuring optimal functionality.\n### Step 1: Install Termux from the Right Source\nContrary to instinct, avoid installing Termux from the Google Play Store, as that version is outdated and no longer maintained . Instead:\n1. Visit the official F-Droid website at`https://f-droid.org`using your Android browser\n2. Download the F-Droid APK and install it (allowing installations from unknown sources if prompted)\n3. Open F-Droid, search for \"Termux\" and install the official version published by Fredrik Fornwall### Step 2: Initial Setup and Package Update\nOnce installed, open Termux and immediately update its packages to ensure you have the latest versions and security patches:\n```\n`pkg update &amp;&amp; pkg upgrade`\n```\nThis command refreshes the package lists and upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions . The initial update is crucial for avoiding compatibility issues with newer packages.\n### Step 3: Configure Storage Permissions\nTo access your device's internal storage (Downloads, DCIM, Documents, etc.), grant storage permissions:\n```\n`termux-setup-storage`\n```\nTap \"Allow\" when the permission prompt appears . This creates a`storage`directory in your Termux home folder that symlinks to your device's storage areas.**Note:**Some users report issues with this command on Android 14 , though it works for most devices.\n### Step 4: Install Essential Packages\nBuild your foundational toolset by installing these essential packages:\n```\n`pkg install git python curl wget nano nodejs`\n```\nThis installs:\n-**Git**: For version control and cloning repositories from GitHub\n-**Python**: A versatile programming language with extensive libraries\n-**cURL &amp; wget**: Tools for downloading files from the internet\n-**Nano**: A user-friendly text editor for coding and configuration\n-**Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming\n### Step 5: Explore Basic Termux Commands\nFamiliarize yourself with these essential commands to navigate and work within Termux:\n|Command|Purpose|Example|\n`pwd`|Shows your current directory|`pwd`|\n`ls`|Lists files and folders|`ls -la`(shows hidden files too)|\n`cd`|Changes directory|`cd /sdcard/Downloads`|\n`mkdir`|Creates a new folder|`mkdir my\\_project`|\n`touch`|Creates a new file|`touch script.py`|\n`cat`|Displays file content|`cat README.md`|\n`python`|Runs Python interpreter or script|`python script.py`|\nThese commands form the foundation of your Termux usage and work identically to their Linux counterparts .\n## Pro Tips and Expert Advice\nBeyond the basic setup, these professional tips will elevate your Termux experience and help you avoid common pitfalls.\n### Keyboard Shortcuts for Efficiency\nTermux supports essential keyboard shortcuts that dramatically improve navigation:\n-**Volume Down + Keyboard Key**: Functions as Ctrl key (Volume Down + L becomes Ctrl+L)\n-**Ctrl + C**: Stop a running command or process\n-**Ctrl + D**: Logout or exit the terminal\n-**Ctrl + Z**: Suspend a process (use`fg`to resume)\n-**Swipe Left**: Open the navigation drawer with additional keys\n### Git Workaround for /sdcard Limitations\nWhen using Git in the`/sdcard`directory, you may encounter permission errors during cloning, committing, or staging operations . The solution is to work primarily in Termux's private directory (`\\~/`or`/data/data/com.termux/files/home`) where you have full read/write permissions, then copy files to shared storage as needed.\n### Installing Ethical Hacking Tools\nMany powerful security tools work without root access:\n```\n`pkg install nmap\ngit clone https://github.com/themikefull/sec-tools\ncd sec-tools\nbash install.sh`\n```\nTools like Nmap (network scanning), SQLmap (SQL injection testing), and Metasploit (penetration testing) can be installed and used for educational purposes and legitimate","favicon":"https://api.ray.so/favicon?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.termuxgenius.com%2F2025%2F08%2Fhow-to-install-termux-android-2025-step-by-step-guide.html","id":"https://www.termuxgenius.com/2025/08/how-to-install-termux-android-2025-step-by-step-guide.html","publishedDate":null,"summary":"The webpage titled \"How to Set up Termux on Android Complete Guide 2025\" provides a comprehensive guide for installing and using Termux, an Android terminal emulator that allows users to run a full Linux environment on their mobile devices without root access.

See[VPNs to Use When Using Termux] for safe network setups.\n## 6) Add language servers to Neovim\n```\n`npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server\npipx install python-lsp-server`\n```\nSet the same keymaps and themes on both devices for muscle memory.\n## 7) Run VS Code in the browser\n```\n`pkg install code-server\ncode-server`\n```\nEdit the config in`\\~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`to set your password. Access it via your phone browser or remote.\n## 8) Test with a local web server\nInstall Nginx for local or LAN testing:\n[Full Nginx in Termux setup guide] \nFor quick public demos:\n```\n`pkg install cloudflared\ncloudflared tunnel --url[http://localhost:3000] `\n```\n## 9) Security practices you can’t skip\n* Use a VPN when on public Wi-Fi. Here’s a detailed[Surfshark VPN review].\n* Use strong passwords and SSH keys —[MaxPhisher in Termux] can test password phishing simulations for awareness training.\n* Keep your packages updated:`pkg upgrade`,`pip list --outdated`,`npm -g outdated`.\n* Have a recovery plan —see[Best Cyber Incident Response Companies] for emergencies.## 10) Troubleshooting common errors\n```\n`Permission denied on sshd\n&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;termux-setup-storage&lt;/code&gt;, then restart sshd. Check if port 8022 is free.&lt;/p&gt;\nnpm install is too slow\n&lt;p&gt;Switch to a closer mirror and try pnpm to save space.&lt;/p&gt;\npip install fails\n&lt;p&gt;Install build tools: &lt;code&gt;pkg install clang make cmake&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;`\n```\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n## Next steps\nPractice by building something small. See[Quick Termux Projects You Can Do] for ideas. If you later host it, apply[Network Security Tips for Small Business] to protect it.\n## Wrap up\nYou now have a portable, secure, and synced dev environment in Termux.

You can download the`Termux:Tasker`APK directly from the site by clicking the`Download APK`link at the bottom of each version section.\nIt usually takes a few days (or even a week or more) for updates to be available on`F-Droid`once an update has been released on`Github`. The`F-Droid`releases are built and published by`F-Droid`once they[detect] a new`Github`release. The Termux maintainers**do not**have any control over the building and publishing of the Termux apps on`F-Droid`. Moreover, the Termux maintainers also do not have access to the APK signing keys of`F-Droid`releases, so we cannot release an APK ourselves on`Github`that would be compatible with`F-Droid`releases.\nThe`F-Droid`app often may not notify you of updates and you will manually have to do a pull down swipe action in the`Updates`tab of the app for it to check updates. Make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app, check[https://dontkillmyapp.com/] for details on how to do that.\n### Github\n[] \n`Termux:Tasker`application can be obtained on`Github`either from[`Github Releases`] for version`&gt;= 0.6.0`or from[`Github Actions`].\nThe APKs for`Github Releases`will be listed under`Assets`drop-down of the release. These are automatically attached when a new version is released.\nThe APKs for`Github Actions`will be listed under`Artifacts`section of the workflow run. These are created for each commit/push done to the repository and can be used by users who don't want to wait for releases and want to try out the latest features immediately or want to test their pull requests. Note that for action workflows, you need to be[**logged into a`Github`account**] for the`Artifacts`links to be enabled/clickable. If you are using the[`Github`app], then make sure to open workflow link in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that has your Github account logged in since the in-app browser may not be logged in.\nThe APKs for both of these are[`debuggable`] and are compatible with each other but they are not compatible with other sources.\n### Google Play Store**(Deprecated)**\n[] \n**Termux and its plugins are no longer updated on[Google Play Store] due to[android 10 issues] and have been deprecated. It is highly recommended to not install Termux apps from Play Store any more.**Check[https://github.com/termux/termux-app#google-play-store-deprecated] for details.\n## ### Setup Instructions\n[] \n#### Install`Termux`app (Mandatory)\n[] \nThe`Termux:Tasker`plugin requires[Termux] app to run the actual commands. You need to install it and start it at least once and have it install the bootstrap files for the plugin to start working. The Termux prefix directory`/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/`and Termux home directory`/data/data/com.termux/files/home/`must also exist and must have read, write and execute permissions`(0700)`for the plugin to work. The`$PREFIX/`is shortcut for the Termux[prefix directory] and can also be referred by the`$PREFIX`shell environment variable. The`\\~/`is a shortcut for the Termux home directory and can also be referred by the`$HOME`shell environment variable. Note that`\\~/`will not expand inside single or double quotes when running commands. Permissions and ownerships can be checked with the`stat &lt;path&gt;`command.\n#### `com.termux.permission.RUN\\_COMMAND`permission (Mandatory)\n[] \nFor`Termux:Tasker`version`&gt;= 0.5`, the plugin host app will need to be granted the`com.termux.permission.RUN\\_COMMAND`permission to run**ANY**plugin commands. This is a security measure to prevent any other apps from running commands in`Termux`context which do not have the required permission granted to them. This is also required for the[RUN\\_COMMAND Intent].\nThe[Tasker] app has requested the permission since`v5.9.3`, so you will need to update the app if you are using an older version. You can grant the permission using the`Permissions`activity in the`App Info`activity of your plugin host app. For`Tasker`you can grant it with:`Android Settings`-&gt;`Apps`-&gt;`Tasker`-&gt;`Permissions`-&gt;`Additional permissions`-&gt;`Run commands in Termux environment`.\nIf you do not grant the permission, you will likely get errors like`receiver com.termux.tasker.FireReceiver requires permission com.termux.permission.RUN\\_COMMAND which we don't have`when running the`Termux:Tasker`plugin action in`Tasker`. Note that, the`%errmsg`for missing permissions will not be set if you are using`Tasker`version`&lt; 5.11.1.beta`and`Continue Task After Error`is enabled, only`%err`will be set to`1`. You can open the plugin configuration screen to detect missing permissions of the plugin host.\n#### `\\~/.termux/tasker/`Directory (Optional)\n[] \nThe`\\~/.termux/tasker/`directory stores the scripts that can be run with the plugin without setting`allow-external-apps`property to`true`if you do not want to use absolute paths. Open a non-root termux session and run the below command to create it and give it read, write and executable permissions`(0700)`. The`tasker`directory must have read permission, otherwise the plugin will not be able to read the script files and give errors like`No regular file found at path`for any script name entered in the`Executable`field of plugin configuration. The`tasker`directory of the script must also have executable permissions for the script to be allowed to execute.\n```\n`mkdir -p /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker\nchmod 700 -R /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux`\n```\n#### `allow-external-apps`property (Optional)\n[] \n`Termux:Tasker`version`&gt;= 0.5`also allows commands to be run outside the`\\~/.termux/tasker/`directory by setting absolute paths in the`Executable`field of the plugin configuration**ONLY**if`allow-external-apps`property is set to`true`in`\\~/.termux/termux.properties`file. This is an added security measure.**DO NOT**set it to true if you have given a relatively untrusted app`com.termux.permission.RUN\\_COMMAND`permission, since it will be able to run arbitrary commands in termux or even root context (assuming termux has been granted root permissions) in the background without user intervention. The`\\~/.termux`directory must have read permission,","favicon":"https://api.ray.so/favicon?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftermux%2Ftermux-tasker","id":"https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker","publishedDate":null,"summary":"The webpage is the GitHub repository for the Termux Tasker add-on, which facilitates integration between the Termux terminal emulator and the Tasker automation app on Android.

Getting command result back is also possible for intents sent with Java, but not possible with`am startservice`command and it will require Termux app version`&gt;= 0.109`.\nYou may also want to check out`termux-tasker`[README].\n### Setup Instructions\n[] \n#### `com.termux.permission.RUN\\_COMMAND`permission (Mandatory)\n[] \nThe Intent sender/third-party app must request the`com.termux.permission.RUN\\_COMMAND`permission in its`AndroidManifest.xml`and it should be granted by user to the app through the app's`App Info``Permissions`page in Android Settings, likely under`Additional Permissions`. This is a security measure to prevent any other apps from running commands in`Termux`context which do not have the required permission granted to them.\nFor`Tasker`you can grant it with:\n`Android Settings`-&gt;`Apps`-&gt;`Tasker`-&gt;`Permissions`-&gt;`Additional permissions`-&gt;`Run commands in Termux environment`.\n#### `allow-external-apps`property (Mandatory)\n[] \nThe`allow-external-apps`property must be set to`true`in`\\~/.termux/termux.properties`in Termux app, regardless of if the executable path is inside or outside the`\\~/.termux/tasker/`directory. Check[here] for more info.\n#### `Draw Over Apps`permission (Optional)\n[] \nFor android`&gt;= 10`there are new[restrictions] that prevent activities from starting from the background. This prevents the background`TermuxService`from starting a terminal session in the foreground and running the commands until the user manually clicks`Termux`notification in the status bar drop-down notifications list. This only affects commands that are to be executed in a terminal session and not the background ones.`Termux`version`&gt;= 0.100`requests the`Draw Over Apps`permission so that users can bypass this restriction so that commands can automatically start running without user intervention.\nYou can grant`Termux`the`Draw Over Apps`permission from its`App Info`activity:\n`Android Settings`-&gt;`Apps`-&gt;`Termux`-&gt;`Advanced`-&gt;`Draw over other apps`.\n#### `Storage`permission (Optional)\n[] \nTermux app must be granted`Storage`permission if the executable is accessing or working directory is set to path in external shared storage. The common paths which usually refer to it are`\\~/storage`,`/sdcard`,`/storage/emulated/0`etc.\nYou can grant`Termux`the`Storage`permission from its`App Info`activity:\nFor Android version &lt; 11:\n`Android Settings`-&gt;`Apps`-&gt;`Termux`-&gt;`Permissions`-&gt;`Storage`.\nFor Android version &gt;= 11\n`Android Settings`-&gt;`Apps`-&gt;`Termux`-&gt;`Permissions`-&gt;`Files and media`-&gt;`Allowed management of all files`.\n**NOTE:**For Android version &gt;= 11, sometimes you will get`Permission Denied`errors for external shared storage even when you have granted`Files and media`permission. To solve this, Deny the permission and then Allow it again and restart Termux. Also check[termux-setup-storage].\n#### Battery Optimizations (May be mandatory depending on device)\n[] \nSome devices kill apps aggressively or prevent apps from starting from background. If Termux is running into such problems, then exempt it from such restrictions. The user may also disable battery optimizations for Termux to reduce the chances of Termux being killed by Android even further due to violation of not being able to call`startForeground()`within`\\~5s`of service start in android &gt;= 8. Check[dontkillmyapp] for device specific info to opt-out of battery optimizations.\n## ### RUN\\_COMMAND Intent Command Extras\n[] \nThe`RUN\\_COMMAND`intent expects the following extras that should contain the info of the command to be executed.\nThe extra constant values are defined by[`TermuxConstants`] class of the[`termux-shared`] library.\n* The`String``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_COMMAND\\_PATH`extra for absolute path of command. (**mandatory**)\n* The`String[]``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_ARGUMENTS`extra for any arguments to pass to command.\n* The`String``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_WORKDIR`extra for current working directory of command. This defaults to`TermuxConstants.TERMUX\\_HOME\\_DIR\\_PATH`.\n* The`boolean``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_BACKGROUND`extra whether to run command in background or foreground terminal session. This defaults to`false`.\n* The`String``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_SESSION\\_ACTION`extra for for session action of foreground commands. This defaults to`TERMUX\\_SERVICE.VALUE\\_EXTRA\\_SESSION\\_ACTION\\_SWITCH\\_TO\\_NEW\\_SESSION\\_AND\\_OPEN\\_ACTIVITY`.*Requires Termux app version`&gt;= 0.109`*.\n* The`String``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_COMMAND\\_LABEL`extra for label of the command.*Requires Termux app version`&gt;= 0.109`*.\n* The markdown`String``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_COMMAND\\_DESCRIPTION`extra for description of the command. This should ideally be get short.*Requires Termux app version`&gt;= 0.109`*.\n* The markdown`String``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_COMMAND\\_HELP`extra for help of the command. This can add details about the command. 3rd party apps can provide more info to users for setting up commands. Ideally a url link should be provided that goes into full details.*Requires Termux app version`&gt;= 0.109`*.\n* The`Parcelable``RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PENDING\\_INTENT`extra containing the pending intent with which result of commands should be returned to the caller. The results will be sent in the`TERMUX\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PLUGIN\\_RESULT\\_BUNDLE`bundle. This is optional and only needed if caller wants the results back.*Requires Termux app version`&gt;= 0.109`*.\nThe`RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_COMMAND\\_PATH`and`RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_WORKDIR`can optionally be prefixed with`$PREFIX/`or`\\~/`if an absolute path is not to be given. The`$PREFIX/`will expand to`TermuxConstants.TERMUX\\_PREFIX\\_DIR\\_PATH`and`\\~/`will expand to`TermuxConstants.TERMUX\\_HOME\\_DIR\\_PATH`.\nThe`EXTRA\\_COMMAND\\_\\*`extras are used for logging and their values are provided to users in case\nof failure in a popup. The popup shown is in[commonmark-spec] markdown using[markwon] library so make sure to follow its formatting rules. Also make sure to end lines with 2 blank spaces to prevent word-wrap wherever needed. It's the users and 3rd party apps responsibility to use them wisely. There are also android internal intent size limits (roughly`500KB`) that must not exceed when sending intents so make sure the combined size of ALL extras is less than that. There are also limits on the arguments size you can pass to commands or the full command string length that can be run, which is likely equal to`131072`bytes or`128KB`on an android device. Check[Arguments and Result Data Limits] for more details.\n## ### RUN\\_COMMAND Intent Result Extras\n[] \nRequires Termux app version`&gt;= 0.109`.\nThe`RUN\\_COMMAND`intent returns the following extras in the`TERMUX\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PLUGIN\\_RESULT\\_BUNDLE`[Bundle] if a pending intent is sent by the caller in the[Parcelable] `RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PENDING\\_INTENT`extra. Getting result of commands back is not possible for intents sent with`am startservice`command and so Java should be used for that case.\nFor foreground commands (`RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_BACKGROUND`is`false`):\n* `TERMUX\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PLUGIN\\_RESULT\\_BUNDLE\\_STDOUT`will contain`session transcript`.\n* `TERMUX\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PLUGIN\\_RESULT\\_BUNDLE\\_STDERR`will be`null`since its not used.\n* `TERMUX\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PLUGIN\\_RESULT\\_BUNDLE\\_EXIT\\_CODE`will contain`exit code`of session.\nFor background commands (`RUN\\_COMMAND\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_BACKGROUND`is`true`):\n* `TERMUX\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PLUGIN\\_RESULT\\_BUNDLE\\_STDOUT`will contain`stdout`of commands.\n* `TERMUX\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PLUGIN\\_RESULT\\_BUNDLE\\_STDERR`will contain`stderr`of commands.\n* `TERMUX\\_SERVICE.EXTRA\\_PLUGIN\\_RESULT\\_BUNDLE\\_EXIT\\_CODE`will contain`exit code`of command.\nThe`session transcript`for foreground commands will contain both`stdout`and`stderr`combined, basically anything sent to the the pseudo terminal`/dev/pts`, including`PS1`prefixes for interactive sessions. Getting separate`stdout`and`stderr`can currently only be done with background commands.\nThe`TERMUX\\_SERVICE.","favicon":"https://api.ray.so/favicon?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftermux%2Ftermux-app%2Fwiki%2FRUN_COMMAND-Intent%2F7c2a42556426b29e0b5b0d60035fbd538dd7b7e5","id":"https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent/7c2a42556426b29e0b5b0d60035fbd538dd7b7e5","publishedDate":null,"summary":"The webpage provides detailed instructions on how third-party applications can execute commands within the Termux app using the `RUN_COMMAND` intent. It explains that these apps can send intents to the `RunCommandService` or act as a plugin host for the `termux-tasker` plugin. Key requirements include obtaining the `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission in the app's `AndroidManifest.xml` and ensuring that the user grants this permission through their device settings. Additionally, the `allow-external-apps` property must be set to `true` in the Termux app's configuration file.

The setup requires a **proot-distro** bypass because Android's kernel blocks Node.js network interfaces, causing *System Error 13* crashes.\n\nHere is the concise automation-ready setup:\n\n## 1. Base Environment\nInstall **Termux from F-Droid** (Play Store builds are deprecated). Then:\n\n```bash\npkg update && pkg upgrade -y\npkg install proot-distro -y\nproot-distro install ubuntu\nproot-distro login ubuntu\n```\n\n## 2. Install OpenClaw\nInside the Ubuntu proot:\n\n```bash\napt update && apt install -y curl git build-essential\ncurl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -\napt install -y nodejs\nnpm install -g openclaw@latest\n```\n\n## 3. The \"Bionic Bypass\" (Critical)\nAndroid blocks `os.networkInterfaces()`. Create a hijack script:\n\n```bash\ncat << 'EOF' > /root/hijack.js\nconst os = require('os');\nos.networkInterfaces = () => ({});\nEOF\n\necho 'export NODE_OPTIONS=\"-r /root/hijack.js\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n## 4. Onboard & Configure\nRun the wizard and **select Loopback (127.0.0.1)** when asked for Gateway Bind (LAN/0.0.0.0 crashes on non-rooted Android):\n\n```bash\nopenclaw onboard\nopenclaw config set gateway.auth.token <your-token>\n```\n\n## 5. Termux-[cmd] Automation Extensions\n\n### A. Termux:Tasker Plugin\nInstall **Termux:Tasker** from F-Droid. Grant `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` in Android Settings → Apps → Tasker → Additional Permissions.\n\nCreate the tasker directory:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.termux/tasker\nchmod 700 -R ~/.termux\n```\n\nPlace launcher scripts in `~/.termux/tasker/`:\n```bash\n#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash\n# openclaw-gateway.sh\nproot-distro login ubuntu -- openclaw gateway --verbose\n```\n\nIn Tasker, use the **Termux:Tasker** action → Executable: `openclaw-gateway.sh`.\n\n### B. RUN_COMMAND Intent (For MacroDroid/Automate)\nEnable external commands:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.termux\necho \"allow-external-apps=true\" >> ~/.termux/termux.properties\n```\n\nThen trigger via intent from any automation app:\n- **Action**: `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND`\n- **Extra**: `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND_PATH` → `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/openclaw-gateway.sh`\n- **Extra**: `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND_BACKGROUND` → `true`\n\n### C. Termux:Widget Shortcuts\nInstall **Termux:Widget**. Scripts in `~/.shortcuts/` appear as home screen widgets:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.shortcuts\necho \"proot-distro login ubuntu -- openclaw gateway\" > ~/.shortcuts/OpenClaw-Start\nchmod +x ~/.shortcuts/OpenClaw-Start\n```\n\n## 6. Keep-Alive Automation\nPrevent Android from killing the session:\n\n```bash\n# In Termux (not proot)\ntermux-wake-lock\n```\n\nAdd to your Termux startup (`~/.bashrc`):\n```bash\ntermux-wake-lock\n```\n\nDisable battery optimization for Termux in Android settings.\n\n## 7. Quick Status Commands\nOnce running, automate health checks via Tasker HTTP GET to `http://127.0.0.1:18789/status` using your gateway token.\n\n**Note:** If you meant the **game** OpenClaw (SDL2 platformer), you need `termux-sdl` from GitHub (lzhiyong/termux-sdl) and must compile it with CMake inside Termux, not proot.

For OpenClaw orchestration, these eliminate the need for Tasker entirely if you're scripting in pure Termux.\n\nHere is how to wire these directly into the **OpenClaw** setup I described earlier:\n\n## 1. Proot-Aware Wrapper Scripts\nSince OpenClaw runs inside `proot-distro ubuntu`, create wrappers in `~/.termux/tasker/` (or `~/.shortcuts/`) that pipe API data into the container:\n\n```bash\n#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash\n# ~/.termux/tasker/openclaw-smart-start.sh\n\n# Keep CPU awake while processing\ntermux-wake-lock\n\n# Notify start\ntermux-notification --id 9001 --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"Gateway starting...\" --ongoing\n\n# Get battery level; abort if <15%\nBATT=$(termux-battery-status | jq -r '.percentage')\nif [ \"$BATT\" -lt 15 ]; then\n    termux-notification --id 9001 --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"Aborted: Battery ${BATT}%\"\n    termux-toast \"Low battery - OpenClaw aborted\"\n    termux-wake-unlock\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Launch in proot with network fix\nexec proot-distro login ubuntu -- bash -c \\\n    'export NODE_OPTIONS=\"-r /root/hijack.js\"; openclaw gateway --verbose' &\nPID=$!\n\n# Update notification with PID\ntermux-notification --id 9001 --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"Running (PID $PID)\" --button1 \"Kill\" --button1-action \"kill $PID; termux-notification-remove 9001\"\n```\n\n## 2. Sensor-Based Automation (No Tasker Needed)\nUse `termux-sensor` to trigger OpenClaw actions based on device movement:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Shake-to-status script\ntermux-sensor -s \"ACCELEROMETER\" -d 1000 -n 1 | jq -r '.values[0]' | while read x; do\n    # If shaken hard (x > 15), check OpenClaw health\n    if (( $(echo \"$x > 15\" | bc -l) )); then\n        STATUS=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18789/status | jq -r '.status')\n        termux-toast \"OpenClaw: $STATUS\"\n        termux-vibrate -d 50\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\n## 3. Clipboard Integration\nCopy API keys or prompts directly into OpenClaw:\n\n```bash\n# Get clipboard content and POST to OpenClaw\nCLIP=$(termux-clipboard-get)\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18789/api/chat \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"message\\\":\\\"$CLIP\\\"}\" | jq -r '.response' | termux-clipboard-set\n\ntermux-toast \"Response copied to clipboard\"\n```\n\n## 4. Speech-to-Command\nVoice-control OpenClaw without touching the screen:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\ntermux-toast \"Listening...\"\nCMD=$(termux-speech-to-text)\ncase \"$CMD\" in\n    *\"start\"*) ~/.termux/tasker/openclaw-smart-start.sh ;;\n    *\"stop\"*) killall node; termux-notification-remove 9001 ;;\n    *\"status\"*) termux-notification --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"$(curl -s localhost:18789/status)\" ;;\nesac\n```\n\n## 5. Scheduling with `termux-job-scheduler`\nInstead of cron (which doesn't persist on Android), use the native scheduler to restart OpenClaw if it crashes:\n\n```bash\n# Schedule health check every 15 minutes\ntermux-job-scheduler --job-id 1 --period-ms 900000 --script ~/.termux/tasker/openclaw-health-check.sh\n\n# Health check script content:\n# if ! curl -s localhost:18789/status > /dev/null; then\n#     termux-notification --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"Crashed - restarting...\"\n#     ~/.termux/tasker/openclaw-smart-start.sh\n# fi\n```\n\n## 6. SAF (Storage Access Framework) for Model Storage\nIf OpenClaw needs to read/write to Google Drive or SD card:\n\n```bash\n# Let user pick a directory via Android picker, persist URI\ntermux-saf-managedir\n\n# Then in OpenClaw config (inside proot), symlink to the SAF mount\n# or use termux-saf-read to pull config files into the container\n```\n\n## Key Difference from Tasker\nThese commands work via **intents** or direct execution, meaning you can trigger them from:\n- **MacroDroid** (via `RUN_COMMAND` intent to Termux)\n- **Automate** (same)\n- **Kode/Script** apps\n- Or simply `ssh` into Termux and run them remotely\n\n**Termux:Tasker** is just a convenience plugin that wraps these same intents. If you're comfortable with shell scripts, using the raw `termux-*` commands you listed gives you finer control (e.g., parsing JSON with `jq` directly instead of Tasker's variable splitting).\n\n**One caveat:** For the proot-distro setup (required for OpenClaw's Node.js), remember that `termux-*` commands live in the **outer** Termux environment. To use them *inside* the Ubuntu container where OpenClaw runs, you need to escape back out:\n\n```bash\n# Inside proot, call outer Termux APIs\nproot-distro login ubuntu -- bash -c \"echo 'Starting' | /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/termux-clipboard-set\"\n```","created_at":1770255402447,"messageId":"4d99ab12-81f3-4e6a-a229-a96942ac20fd","model":"kimi-k2.5-thinking","modelParams":{"includeSearch":true,"reasoningEffort":"medium"},"parts":[{"providerMetadata":{"openrouter":{"reasoning_details":[{"format":"unknown","index":0,"text":".)","type":"reasoning.text"}]}},"reasoning":" The user is pointing out that I mentioned Termux:Tasker in my previous response about OpenClaw setup, but they're providing a comprehensive markdown list of Termux commands that seems to be from Termux:API or core Termux utilities. \n\nWait, looking at the markdown they provided - it's a detailed guide to Termux commands (termux-* commands).

These are Termux:API commands (require the Termux:API app)\n2. They can be used directly in scripts or via the RUN_COMMAND intent\n3. They provide finer-grained control than Tasker alone\n4. For OpenClaw automation specifically, these allow sensor-based triggers, notifications, etc.\n\nI should integrate this into the OpenClaw context - showing how these specific commands can automate OpenClaw operations (like using termux-notification for status, termux-wake-lock to keep it alive, termux-toast for alerts, etc.)","type":"reasoning"},{"text":" You're right—I focused on **Termux:Tasker** as the bridge, but these native **Termux:API** commands are the actual primitives for automation. For OpenClaw orchestration, these eliminate the need for Tasker entirely if you're scripting in pure Termux.\n\nHere is how to wire these directly into the **OpenClaw** setup I described earlier:\n\n## 1. Proot-Aware Wrapper Scripts\nSince OpenClaw runs inside `proot-distro ubuntu`, create wrappers in `~/.termux/tasker/` (or `~/.shortcuts/`) that pipe API data into the container:\n\n```bash\n#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash\n# ~/.termux/tasker/openclaw-smart-start.sh\n\n# Keep CPU awake while processing\ntermux-wake-lock\n\n# Notify start\ntermux-notification --id 9001 --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"Gateway starting...\" --ongoing\n\n# Get battery level; abort if <15%\nBATT=$(termux-battery-status | jq -r '.percentage')\nif [ \"$BATT\" -lt 15 ]; then\n    termux-notification --id 9001 --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"Aborted: Battery ${BATT}%\"\n    termux-toast \"Low battery - OpenClaw aborted\"\n    termux-wake-unlock\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Launch in proot with network fix\nexec proot-distro login ubuntu -- bash -c \\\n    'export NODE_OPTIONS=\"-r /root/hijack.js\"; openclaw gateway --verbose' &\nPID=$!\n\n# Update notification with PID\ntermux-notification --id 9001 --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"Running (PID $PID)\" --button1 \"Kill\" --button1-action \"kill $PID; termux-notification-remove 9001\"\n```\n\n## 2. Sensor-Based Automation (No Tasker Needed)\nUse `termux-sensor` to trigger OpenClaw actions based on device movement:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Shake-to-status script\ntermux-sensor -s \"ACCELEROMETER\" -d 1000 -n 1 | jq -r '.values[0]' | while read x; do\n    # If shaken hard (x > 15), check OpenClaw health\n    if (( $(echo \"$x > 15\" | bc -l) )); then\n        STATUS=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18789/status | jq -r '.status')\n        termux-toast \"OpenClaw: $STATUS\"\n        termux-vibrate -d 50\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\n## 3. Clipboard Integration\nCopy API keys or prompts directly into OpenClaw:\n\n```bash\n# Get clipboard content and POST to OpenClaw\nCLIP=$(termux-clipboard-get)\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18789/api/chat \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"message\\\":\\\"$CLIP\\\"}\" | jq -r '.response' | termux-clipboard-set\n\ntermux-toast \"Response copied to clipboard\"\n```\n\n## 4. Speech-to-Command\nVoice-control OpenClaw without touching the screen:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\ntermux-toast \"Listening...\"\nCMD=$(termux-speech-to-text)\ncase \"$CMD\" in\n    *\"start\"*) ~/.termux/tasker/openclaw-smart-start.sh ;;\n    *\"stop\"*) killall node; termux-notification-remove 9001 ;;\n    *\"status\"*) termux-notification --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"$(curl -s localhost:18789/status)\" ;;\nesac\n```\n\n## 5. Scheduling with `termux-job-scheduler`\nInstead of cron (which doesn't persist on Android), use the native scheduler to restart OpenClaw if it crashes:\n\n```bash\n# Schedule health check every 15 minutes\ntermux-job-scheduler --job-id 1 --period-ms 900000 --script ~/.termux/tasker/openclaw-health-check.sh\n\n# Health check script content:\n# if ! curl -s localhost:18789/status > /dev/null; then\n#     termux-notification --title \"OpenClaw\" --content \"Crashed - restarting...\"\n#     ~/.termux/tasker/openclaw-smart-start.sh\n# fi\n```\n\n## 6. SAF (Storage Access Framework) for Model Storage\nIf OpenClaw needs to read/write to Google Drive or SD card:\n\n```bash\n# Let user pick a directory via Android picker, persist URI\ntermux-saf-managedir\n\n# Then in OpenClaw config (inside proot), symlink to the SAF mount\n# or use termux-saf-read to pull config files into the container\n```\n\n## Key Difference from Tasker\nThese commands work via **intents** or direct execution, meaning you can trigger them from:\n- **MacroDroid** (via `RUN_COMMAND` intent to Termux)\n- **Automate** (same)\n- **Kode/Script** apps\n- Or simply `ssh` into Termux and run them remotely\n\n**Termux:Tasker** is just a convenience plugin that wraps these same intents. If you're comfortable with shell scripts, using the raw `termux-*` commands you listed gives you finer control (e.g., parsing JSON with `jq` directly instead of Tasker's variable splitting).\n\n**One caveat:** For the proot-distro setup (required for OpenClaw's Node.js), remember that `termux-*` commands live in the **outer** Termux environment. To use them *inside* the Ubuntu container where OpenClaw runs, you need to escape back out:\n\n```bash\n# Inside proot, call outer Termux APIs\nproot-distro login ubuntu -- bash -c \"echo 'Starting' | /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/termux-clipboard-set\"\n```","type":"text"}],"providerMetadata":{"openrouter":{"provider":"Novita","reasoning_details":[{"format":"unknown","index":0,"text":" The user is pointing out that I mentioned Termux:Tasker in my previous response about OpenClaw setup, but they're providing a comprehensive markdown list of Termux commands that seems to be from Termux:API or core Termux utilities. \n\nWait, looking at the markdown they provided - it's a detailed guide to Termux commands (termux-* commands).
